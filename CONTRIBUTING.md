Some Notes on Pull Requests:
* If you can't code, or don't want to. Open an issue regarding the topic and I will take care of it.
* Don't worry too heavily on code styling. Although please make it readable. If I find mistakes in the PR I will fix it myself.
* Please include a description of the PR. Don't say "just look you'll find out what it does" or leave it blank.
* Please make it relevant. This is a text editor not a book on the history of rocks.
